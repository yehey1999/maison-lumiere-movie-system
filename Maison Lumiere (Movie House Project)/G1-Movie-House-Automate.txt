 1.) A landing page showing information about the company is displayed on the screen. Menu (or links) for User login.
 2.) A user (whom the owner wants to be the admin of the system) will register a customer and/or product.
 3.) Once the user successfully logs in the system, a dashboard (with a set of menu) appears on the screen.
